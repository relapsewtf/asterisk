ExecArtefactHunter — Collector + Correlator skeleton that finds executed files and flags suspicious ones by applying configurable rules.

Quickstart (Windows developer machine)

Install Rust toolchain (stable) and Node.js (LTS).

Build collector:

cd collector
cargo build --release

Run collector on a folder (admin recommended for access to system artifacts):

target/release/collector --scan C:\Users\Public\samples --out findings.json

Start the UI (optional):

cd ui
npm install
npm start

The UI expects the collector to expose a simple REST endpoint /api/findings that serves findings.json. For now you can cat findings.json into a small static server or adapt the collector to serve HTTP.
